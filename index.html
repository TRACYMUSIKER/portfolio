                Originally hailing from Albany, NY - I’ve been living in the southeast for over 6 years I come with varied work experiences (retail, legal, fitness, nursing, management) and a bachelor’s in Biology.
                
                I’ve had an interest in programming for years that remained idle until 2018. That interest was first cultivated from growing up the first kid on the block with a computer in my neighborhood. I loved math in grade school and co-founded a logic club in college. I watched close friends become involved in computer science careers, and the world evolve to a tech-driven society. I developed a humanitarian side, volunteering overseas and in local soup kitchens. Then I heard of the emergence of coding bootcamps. I knew I could revive the logical thinking I displayed in college, and combine it with finding purpose with positive contributions to the world through code. And that set into motion this new coding journey…
